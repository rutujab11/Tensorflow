# Tensorflow
Getting started with Tensorflow

Tensorflow features:
1. Efficiently works with mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays
2. Good support of deep neural networks and machine learning concepts
3. GPU/CPU computing where the same code can be executed on both architectures
4. High scalability of computation across machines and huge data sets

Tensorboard and visualization analysis
TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:
1. Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
2. Visualizing the model graph
3. Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
4. Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
5. Displaying images, text, and audio data
6. Profiling TensorFlow programs
